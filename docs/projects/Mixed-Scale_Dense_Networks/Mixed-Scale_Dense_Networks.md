## Mixed-Scale Dense Networks

This page shows how to train Mixed-Scale Dense Networks for phase retrieval with single and multiple distance acquisitions, and from recostructed tomograms.

The process is divided as follows:

1) Generating simulation data to train the network.

1) Training the network the simulated.

1) Testing the trained network on simulated and experimental data. 

1) Generating training datasets from experimental data.

1) Training the networks on the experimental data.

1) Testing the trained networks on test data.
